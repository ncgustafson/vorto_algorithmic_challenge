# vorto_algorithmic_challenge

A solution to the vorto algorithmic challenge using a nearest neighbor heuristic, along with intra and inter relocation improvement heuristics.



**SETUP** (an executable is already provided in the repo):

  In the vorto_algorithmic_challenge folder, run the following in the terminal to build the project:
  
      g++ -Wall -Werror main.cpp -o main.o


  
  Once the executable is created, run the program:
  
      ./main.o <filepath>
      
  EXAMPLE: 
    
      ./main.o "Training Problems/problem1.txt"
