# vorto_algorithmic_challenge

A solution to the vorto algorithmic challenge using a nearest neighbor heurisitc, along with intra and inter relocation improvement heuristics.

SETUP (an executable is already provided in the repo):

  -In the vorto_algorithmic_challenge folder, run the following in the terminal to build the project:
      g++ -Wall -Werror main.cpp -o main.o

  -Once the executable is created, run the program by:
      ./main.o <filepath>
      EX: ./main.o "Training Problems/problem1.txt"
